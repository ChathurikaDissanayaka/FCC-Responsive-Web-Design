            <p>Chester Charles Bennington was an American singer, songwriter, 
                and occasional actor. He served as the lead vocalist of the 
                bands Linkin Park, Grey Daze, Dead by Sunrise, and Stone Temple 
                Pilots.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bennington first became famous as a vocalist with the release of 
                the band, Linkin Park's debut album "Hybrid Theory" (2000). Hybrid 
                Theory was a worldwide commercial success. Linkin Park's following 
                studio albums, from Meteora (2003) to One More Light (2017), 
                continued the band's success.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bennington formed his band, Dead by Sunrise, as a side project in 2005. 
                The band's debut album, Out of Ashes, was released on October 13, 2009. 
                He became the lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots in 2013 to release the 
                extended play record High Rise on October 8, 2013, via their own record 
                label, Play Pen, but left in 2015 to focus solely on Linkin Park. As an 
                actor, he appeared in films such as Crank (2006), Crank: High Voltage 
                (2009), and Saw 3D (2010).
            </p>
            <p>
                Bennington struggled with depression and substance abuse for most of his 
                life, starting in his childhood. On July 20, 2017, he was found dead at 
                his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California; his death was ruled a 
                suicide by hanging.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hit Parader magazine placed Bennington at number 46 on their list of the 
                "Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time". Bennington has been credited by 
                several publications as one of the greatest rock vocalists of his 
                generation.
